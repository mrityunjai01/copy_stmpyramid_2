# STMPyramid
## Running the code
Simply change constants in constants.py.


```python main.py``` is enough to run the code after that.

#### Note:
Please ensure all libraries have been downloaded before running the code.

### Request:
- In case you encounter any bugs, please bring it to my notice immediately.
- If you have any suggestions for features to be added, let me know as well.

### Known Bugs:
1. SHTM giving error.

### TODO:
1. More datasets in loader
2. Better cross validation / grid search pipeline with more information
3. In case any grid search hyperparameter gives error, please handle that with 'try except block' 
4. Saving the images and data to another folder
5. More solvers (and adding the hyperparams in the pipeline)
6. Method in constants for diff weight constraints
